# Eternal-2.4-Partial-Deobf

---

### Semi-important information:

- Minecraft.java is `FC`
- Main Eternal Class is `f8`

fields are the same as decomped mcp, so manual remapping is easy enough

some methods fail to decompile, use original eternal jar for comparasion (linked in repo)

used CFR and an online deobfuscator to do the light work for me already

why? cause why not i dont care im bored so here u go

strings are already deobfed, do as u please
